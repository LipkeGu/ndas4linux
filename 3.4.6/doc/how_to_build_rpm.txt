= How to build the rpm =
After you have a working NDAS version on your system, you can use these 
instructions to test if the rpm build packages can install and run.


== Prerequisites ==

	make, gcc, bzip2, kernel-devel, rpm-build 


== How to build ==
The basic procedure is as follows:

	Download the kernel version tarball.
	Use rpmbuild to create the installer.
	Find the kernel module and admin package and install. 


== Where is the tarball? ==
You can download a previously exported version from our downloads at 
http://linux.iocellnetworks.com or you can use the exported tarball resulting
from the how_to_export.txt instructions. 


== Building the installer ==

	$ rpmbuild -tb ndas-3.4-4.x86.tar.gz 

On the default Fedora machine it generates the packages your home dir. 

	$ ls ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/
	ndas-admin-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386.rpm   
	ndas-kernel-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386.rpm


== Install and test ==
When ndas-admin-x.rpm installs it should automatically start ndas.

	$ cd ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/
	$ sudo rpm -ivh ndas-kernel-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386.rpm
	$ sudo rpm -ivh ndas-admin-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386.rpm 


== Removing rpms
When the kernel version changes, you may need to remove the existing versions
then rebuild from the new source.

	$ sudo ndasadmin disable -s #    <- Do this for each slot that is in use
	$ sudo rpm -ev ndas-admin-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386 
	$ sudo rpm -ev ndas-kernel-3.4.4.x86-fc16.i386
