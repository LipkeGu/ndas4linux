= How To Install NDAS From Source = 
This document only applies to the pre-built client source code. If you need to export the client source code for other distributions or different kernel versions, checkout the repository, then follow the instructions in doc/howtobuild.txt.

== Prerequisites ==
* make
* gcc
* kernel headers for your distribution (or a compiled kernel source code and cross compiling tool chain).
* kernel development packages (if they are provided by your distribtuion)

Optional tools/programs
* wget
* rpm-build 


== Download and build ==
NDAS client source code is versioned after the running kernel from the major distributions for which we offer support. These are no longer fully backward compatible, so start with the nearest, lower version to your system based on the result of "uname -r. " It it compiles and runs, you are ok. If not, try the next higher version. The changes are realtively few so far in the block layer. Basic procedure goes like so:

1. Download a source tarball. 
1. Unpack
1. Enter the folder and run make
1. Change to root or sudo make install
1. Start ndas as root
1. As root, or by sudo, register and enable ndas connected drives with ndasadmin
