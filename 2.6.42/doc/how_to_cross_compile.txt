= How to cross compile =
Now and then you might need to tell the compiler where to find the kernel 
source. You may also want to set the architecture in your current env.

	export NDAS_KERNEL_PATH=/path/to/kernel/source

	export NDAS_KERNEL_ARCH=arm

There are some other examples for exporting and building more complex cases
in the Makefiles and some in the arch folder.
