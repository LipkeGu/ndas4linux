Method for choosing fedora f## is not reliable. Should be changed
in ndas.spec

platform/linux/tarball-tag/Makefile should export with the correct
setting for NDAS_DEBUG. Currently, debug needs to be turned on 
when compiling the dbg source.

update references to SLOT_R(q) so they cast correctly according to 
variable size and need.

find out why ndas_core does not de-reference ndas_change_handler_func
when the module is removed. ticket 1

debian export script does not make the deb file correctly. the modules
do not install after running dpkg on the .dep file.

blkid bug hack:
Mus properly map the slot->disk->private_data to the device. It currently
contains one integer that represents the slot. Possibly:
	slot->disk->private_data = slot

Search for and remove:
	NDAS_MSHARE sections of all code
	Kernel version < 2.6 code
	jukebox code
	ucosii references
	ps2dev references
	vxworks references

Update to later kernel versions for delivery to linux/drivers/staging
	
complete "ndasadmin scheduler" function

test and test and test with all ndas hardware.
