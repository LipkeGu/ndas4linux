Use the NDAS Administration tool to connect the computer to the NDAS device on
the Local Area Network. Once the drive is enabled, treat it as any other local
disk mounting according to the typical tools in your system.

All commands should be run as root or using sudo.

 sudo ndasadmin [command] options 

Commands and options are as follows:

==start==
Starts the NDAS driver. 


==stop==
Attempts to disable slots and stops the NDAS driver.


==register==
Register a new netdisk with ID and name or serial number. If registration is
successful you can find the slot when NDAS disk is online, by 

	cat /proc/ndas/devs.

'''Options:'''
 -n | --name         The local name by which you may remember the NDAS device.
                     No spaces should be used in the name. So the underscore 
                     is a useful replacement. Such as "NDAS_Device_1"
 -b | --background   to run device detection process in background.

'''Notes:'''
* The slot number is used for enabling and disabling the device.
* When device is registered using only the serial number, the device can be
  only used in read-only mode.

'''Example by NDAS ID with Write Key: '''

	sudo ndasadmin register XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-WWWWW -n NetDisk1

'''Example registration by serial number:'''

 	sudo ndasadmin register XXXXXXXX -n NetDisk1 -b 


==unregister==
Remove a registered netdisk by name

'''Example'''

	sudo ndasadmin unregister -n|--name NDASName


==edit==
Simply changes the name of the registered NDAS Device. 

'''Example'''

	sudo ndasadmin edit -o NDASDeviceName -n NewNDASDeviceName


==enable==
Enable a registered netdisk with slot number or block device name.

'''Options'''

 -s      Slot number
 -o      Access mode. 
          r = (read only mode)
          w = (exclusive write mode) other computers can still use read only mode.
          s = (shared write) For use with multi client file systems only! Multiple 
              hosts can enable the same device in write mode so coordination between
              hosts is required or file system corruption will occur.

'''Example using the slot number and exclusive write mode:'''

	sudo ndasadmin enable -s 1 -o w

'''Example using the block device location and read only mode:''' 

	sudo ndasadmin enable -f /dev/ndas-000012-0 -o r


==disable==
Disable enabled device by slot number or block device

'''Example using the slot number:'''

	sudo ndasadmin disable -s 1

'''Example using the block device location:'''

	sudo ndasadmin disable -f /dev/ndas-000012-0


==request==
Request other host in the network to give up write access of the device.

'''Example:'''

	sudo ndasadmin request -s SlotNumber
