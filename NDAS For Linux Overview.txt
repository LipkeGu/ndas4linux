NDAS For Linux Overview

The NDAS Driver was created by Ximeta Inc. Official development stopped around August 2008. It was working with Linux Kernel 2.6.24 at that time. Some NDAS user created patches that kept the driver working until kernel version 2.6.35. 

The last active source code from Ximeta is in the "ximeta" directory of this repository. It should be updated and patched to operate on the latest kernels and then branched into a more manageable system that can be integrated into the kernel or at least packaged for standard distribution with any kernel version.

This code can export into various architectures and contains some projects that are no longer supported. 

The patches were created by users at code.ximeta.com can be applied in order once the main export is done. 

You will need a gcc compiler and make to create the driver.
