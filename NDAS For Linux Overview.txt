NDAS For Linux Overview

The NDAS Driver was created by Ximeta Inc. Official development stopped around
August 2008. It was working with Linux Kernel 2.6.24 at that time. Some NDAS
users created patches that kept the driver working until kernel version 2.6.35. 

The last active source code from Ximeta is in the "ximeta" directory of this
repository. It should be updated and patched to operate on the latest kernels
and then branched into a more manageable system that can be integrated into
the kernel or at least packaged for standard distribution with any kernel
version.

As of this revision, there is no settled license for this full source code, so
please leave copyrights and license statments intact. Most device driver
portions are GNU GPL already, but you will find some sections that are 
copyrighted by Ximeta. Please send all feedback and suggestions for licensing, 
especially reasons why full gnu is preferred to linux@iocellnetworks.com, or 
post to the ndas4linux@iocellnetworks.com list.

This code can export into various architectures and contains some projects 
that are no longer supported. 

The patches were created by users at code.ximeta.com can be applied in order 
once the main export is done. 

The history of bugs and public changes are online at the original trac server.

You will need a gcc compiler and make to create the driver. 

Start with doc/howtobuild.txt for the basics. This will give you an exported 
version that would run on some system. 

There are some premade targets in arch/targets. You can see how the nxp-* 
flags work in there. 

Also in this directory you see noop.settings.scripts.tar. This fixes a bug 
that froze the system as soon as you enabled the NDAS Device. It is not made a 
patch, because the submitter was not sure if it is accpetable code or not, but 
it works and has a good idea in the readme.
