This document only applies to the pre-built client source code. If you need to
export the client source code for other distributions or different kernel
versions, checkout the repository, then follow the instructions in
doc/howtobuild.txt. 


==Prerequisites==

* dpkg-dev
* debhelper
* gcc 
* bzip2
* fakeroot
* module-assistant
* libc6-dev
* build-essential

You can run the following commands with root privilege:

 apt-get install dpkg-dev debhelper gcc bzip2 fakeroot module-assistant
 apt-get install libc6-dev build-essential install linux-headers-`uname -r`


==Download and build==
NDAS client source code is versioned after the running kernel from the major
distributions for which we offer support. These are no longer fully backward
compatible, so if there is not the exact kernel version, start with the
nearest, lower version to your system based on the result of "uname -r. " If it
compiles and runs, you are ok. If not, try the next higher version. The changes
are realtively few so far in the block layer. Basic procedure goes like so:

# Download a source tarball.
# Unpack.
# Move to the source folder.
# Create .deb installers with dpkg.
# Move up install the modules source.
# As root or with sudo, build and install with module-assistant.
# As root or sudo, install the ndasadmin tool.
# As root or sudo, register and enable ndas connected drives with ndasadmin.

'''Example:'''

 wget http://linux.iocellnetworks.com/src/ndas-3.2.0.x86_64.tar.gz
 tar zxvf ndas-3.2.0.x86_64.tar.gz
 cd ndas-3.2.0.x86_64.tar.gz
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
 cd ..


==Installing the .deb packages==
If you just created the packages following instructions above it should be
fine. If you downloaded a .deb file, you might need to install the
prerequisites listed above. This is using the module assistant to install the
packages.

Move to the folder where your archives are located, install the modules source,
then use module assistant to get everything up and running.

'''Example:'''

 sudo dpkg -i ndas-modules-src_3.2.0.x64_amd64.deb
 sudo m-a prepare
 sudo m-a update
 sudo m-a auto-install ndas
 sudo dpkg -i ndasadmin_3.2.0.x64_amd64.deb
 sudo ndasadmin help


==Removing the packages== 

Make make sure to dismount any drives that are in use, then remove both
packages as below.


 sudo dpkg -r ndasadmin
 sudo dpkg -r ndas-modules-src
 sudo dpkg -r ndas-modules-`uname -r`


Admin should be removed first, to satisfy dependencies. You can also specify -P
rather than -r to purge all configuration data.
