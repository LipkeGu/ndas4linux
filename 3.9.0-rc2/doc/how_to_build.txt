= How To Install NDAS From Source = 
This document only applies to the pre-built client source code. If a prebuilt
version for your kernel is not available on the download page, please follow
the instructions in how_to_export.txt to export your specific kernel version
and architecture. 

== Prerequisites ==
* make
* gcc
* kernel headers for your distribution (or a compiled kernel source code and
  cross compiling tool chain).
* kernel development packages (if they are provided by your distribtuion)

Optional tools/programs
* wget
* rpm-build 


== Download and build ==
NDAS client source code is versioned after the running kernel from the major
distributions for which we offer support. These are no longer fully backward
compatible, so start with the nearest, lower version to your system based on
the result of "uname -r. " It it compiles and runs, you are ok. If not, try
the next higher version. The changes are realtively few so far in the block
layer. Basic procedure goes like so:

1. Download a source tarball. 
1. Unpack
1. Enter the folder and run make
1. Change to root or sudo make install
1. Start ndas as root
1. As root, or by sudo, register and enable ndas devices with ndasadmin  


''' Example: '''

[user@fc17 ~]$ wget http://ndas4linux.iocellnetworks.com/trac/index.cgi/export/HEAD/ndas4linux/release/ndas-3.4.5.x86_64.tar.gz
[user@fc17 ~]$ tar zxvf ndas-3.4.5.x86_64.tar.gz 
[user@fc17 ~]$ cd ndas-3.4.5.x86_64
[user@fc17 ndas-3.4.5.x86_64]$ make 
[user@fc17 ndas-3.4.5.x86_64]$ sudo make install
[user@fc17 ndas-3.4.5.x86_64]$ sudo /etc/init.d/ndas start
