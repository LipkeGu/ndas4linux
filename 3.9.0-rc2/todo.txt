There are several compiler warnings that do not seem to affect usage.
They should be cured.

Method for choosing fedora f## is not reliable. Should be changed
in ndas.spec

update references to SLOT_R(q) so they cast correctly according to 
variable size and need.

find out why ndas_core does not de-reference ndas_change_handler_func
when the module is removed. ticket 1

debian export script does not make the deb file correctly. the modules
do not install after running dpkg on the .dep file.

blkid bug hack:
Must properly map the slot->disk->private_data to the device. It currently
contains one integer that represents the slot. Possibly:
	slot->disk->private_data = slot

Search for and remove:
	NDAS_MSHARE sections of all code
	Kernel version < 2.6 code
	jukebox code
	ucosii references
	ps2dev references
	vxworks references

Update to later kernel versions for delivery to linux/drivers/staging
	
complete "ndasadmin scheduler" function

test and test and test with all ndas hardware.
