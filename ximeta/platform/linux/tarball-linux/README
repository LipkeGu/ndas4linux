1. Register the NetDisk

 You can find NDAS "ID" and NDAS "key" from the the bottom of the NetDisk.

 If your NDAS ID (20 characters) and NDAS key (5 characters) are

  ID: AF7R2-2MKK4-UHG9S-5RHTG
  KEY: 8QT6U

 then execute the following commands.

/usr/sbin/ndasadmin register AF7R2-2MKK4-UHG9S-5RHTG-8QT6U --name MyDisk

 Please note that 'MyDisk' is any name named by you.
 You will get the numeric slot number(s) for each disk on the NetDisk by
 
cat /proc/ndas/devices/MyDisk/slots
 
 check the status of the NetDisk, if you can get the slot number from commands above.

cat /proc/ndas/devs

 Make sure the NetDisk turns on and is attached in the same network.

2. To enable the NetDisk, please type the following commands:

 Use the numeric slot number that you get from /proc/ndas/devices/MyDisk/slots.  if you get '1' as the slot number from /proc/ndas/devices/MyDisk/slots then, execute one of the following command.
 
/usr/sbin/ndasadmin enable -s 1 -o w   ( exclusive write and read mode )

/usr/sbin/ndasadmin enable -s 1 -o r   ( read-only mode )

/usr/sbin/ndasadmin enable -s 1 -o s   ( for GFS file system )

 This command will print out the path of the block device file. For example,  /dev/nda, /dev/ndb, /dev/ndas-001000001:0.

Your NetDisk will then have to be partitioned and/or formatted if not already.
 
3. To partition or format, please do the following:

WARNING: All data will be erased.

# fdisk /dev/nda, 
# mkfs -t ext2 /dev/nda1 ...

Your NetDisk is now ready for use!

To Unregister the NetDisk

/usr/sbin/ndasadmin unregister --name MyDisk
 
 Note: 'unregister' is to delete the registration so that the NetDisk is not registered in the next booting of Linux machine.
