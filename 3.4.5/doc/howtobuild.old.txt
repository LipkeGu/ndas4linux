 * Build Options
   - debug output
	set/unset XPLAT_DEBUG
   - compiler optimization
	set XPLAT_OPTIMIZATION="" to disable the compiler optimization
	set XPLAT_OPTIMIZATION="-O1" to compile the code with -O1 flags
	if unset and XPLAT_DEBUG is set, the objects is generated with -O2
	if unset and XPLAT_DEBUG is unset, the objects is generated without -O2

 * Linux kernel mode
   - For x86 kernel, execute
     ( export NDAS_KERNEL_PATH=/usr/src/linux-2.4.21-99;
       export NDAS_KERNEL_VERSION=2.4.21-99;
       make nxp-os=linux linux-rel i686-rpm)
     if you don't specify the path and the version, the Makefile will guess the version by 'uname -r' and look for the traditional path for the kernel

 * Linux user mode
   - For x86, just run make
   - Set nxp-cpu environment variable to CPU name and nxp-os to linuxum. Currently supported nxp-cpu is x86 only.

 * vxWorks
   - Define __VXWORKS__ in project setting.

 * PS2
   - Run ps2env.bat in cygwin environment. 
   - Run ps2make.sh in linux environment.
     Make sure 
        the ps2sdk is installed on /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk
        the ps2lib is installed on /usr/local/ps2dev/ps2lib
